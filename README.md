Project Description
We plan to develop a mobile application that provides users with vacation recommendations based on their preferences for price, weather and activities. By collecting this data, we can query a database of different vacation options and return a list that best matches the userâ€™s criteria. As a result, this application would significantly reduce the time and stress it takes to plan a vacation.
To build this application, we will use a cross platform language that supports both Android and iOS, create a database of different vacation options, and pull in data from the Internet over approximate airfare and hotel costs.
